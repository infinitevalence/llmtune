//! Advisory locks so GPU-touching operations don't run at once.
//!
//! A single `flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)` per lock file gives real mutual exclusion:
//! the kernel releases it automatically when the holding process exits (even on a
//! crash), so there are no stale lock files and no TOCTOU window. `swap` and
//! `bench` share ONE lock (they both drive the one GPU, so they must be mutually
//! exclusive); `build` (a CPU compile) has its own, so it may run alongside.
//!
//! The lock dir is chosen so it is ALWAYS writable by the invoking user: root
//! uses `/run/llmtune`, a non-root user its `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/llmtune` (falling
//! back to a per-uid temp dir). If the dir genuinely can't be created, locking is
//! unavailable and the op proceeds best-effort (as before) rather than blocking.
